 Python API User Guide
=======================

Once you have installed ``python-cratonclient``, there are a few things you
need to get started using the Python API:

#. You need to know how to authenticate to the Craton API you wish to talk to

   Some Craton API services will be deployed using Craton's in-built
   authentication system while others may use Keystone.

#. You need your credentials

#. You need the location of your Craton API service

This chapter of python-cratonclient's documentation is broken down into
